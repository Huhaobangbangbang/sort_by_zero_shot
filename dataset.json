See my photos, the camera doesn't lie!This cat tree is so cheaply made because it is simply stapled to these plastic cylindrical pieces that are supposed to hold all the carpeted pieces together.Do yourself a favor and pay $30 more (for about $130), and get yourself the better-made cat tree! This is a piece of junk. What really bothers me is that it is now too late to return it because I've had it now 2 months. They only have a 30-day return policy! I now have a cat tree that is all in pieces, and absolutely worthless. I had left my nice cat tree behind (which looked just like it, but was made WAY BETTER), because we moved to a new house.

In fact, I attached my own toy and it is still hanging.Second, or fifth...who's counting...it smelled like an epoxy...can you imagine laying on it...EEK.

Our cats are not oversized, about 7 pounds, a Siamese that likes to jump and climb. I contacted the seller and was informed they could not just send the plastic piece so I could add a large washer before the nut to make a more stable design; the cost of the piece is outrageous (see below)Gopetclub states, “The posts come with the plastic ends attached so you will have to order the whole post. They cost about $10 each, before shipping and handling charges of $18.71.” that is $28.71 for one post!The poor design is just not worth it, and the price to replace faulty parts with equally faulty parts is just throwing good money after bad, do not purchase!

The Amazon rep had me package up the broken part and send back for a replacement. Then a whole new tree arrived, and guess what?!? The same part was broken in the replacement!

Now after three months of use (admittedly by more cats than there are platforms) it's ready to go to the dump. During that time I had to re-tighten the hardware on a near-daily basis (because the materials compress over time), the carpet sucked up massive amounts of dirt, debris and cat snot like a sponge, and most of the sisal came off and was distributed throughout the house.Now the top platform hardware can no longer be tightened enough to avoid tipping when a cat sits off center.Admittedly our numerous and very active cats require industrial strength everything, and they don't seem to know they're risking life and limb just using this thing. Nonetheless, this can only be considered a throw-away, disposable product. What our cats took three months to do to it, any three normal cats can accomplish in under two years (and it'll spend at least half of that time being the kind of eyesore best surrounded by high fencing)...",

It was actually difficult to put together due to this and also gave me a skin and throat irritation. It's still like this a few days later as we write this. The rope is rough. I do not see a need for two ladders and they should be longer. Once installed, it's at a pretty steep 60° angle and it seems like the lower room doesn't get used because it's not easily accessed. I would have also liked for one side to be completely flush with itself so it will sit better against a wall. It may be designed to sit flush but this one will not.

I don't have any allergies that I'm aware of. The room started to appear to spin. I had to put the cat tree outside and ventilate my house and it took forever to be able to breathe properly. I lied down with a splitting headache while hallucinating for hours. It was extremely painful and horrifying. Even after we aired it out outside for a couple of days, it was still extremely toxic. I couldn't get near it even when it was outside on my balcony in the open air. No one in my family could go near it without getting extremely sick. We had to hire someone to rebox it so we could return it. I will never buy from Go Pet Club again. I suspect some of the five star reviews are either fake or the humans using this thing are rarely at home or never get near it. It is not safe! It has scared me off of buying cat furniture online. I'll probably save up the $200 or so needed to get a decently safe, if slightly more boring looking, cat tree from a local pet store so I can at least be sure it isn't deadly poisonous. Beware of this one! I'm sorry to leave such a scathing review, but this was beyond horrible and I lost money shipping it back because I couldn't even touch it.

It was annoying to put all the pieces together but I just got a cup of coffee and took my time. I was very disappointed in the quality. I wish I would have returned it immediately. I decided to keep it and planned on recovering it with real carpeting since the material covering the unit was cheap, thin felt- like fabric that is glued on. It pills up, is very easily shredded by cat claws, and was a constant mess for a few feet around the base of the cat tree. I had to vacuum daily and there was raw wood showing within the first week just from ripping as my cat climbed up to the upper levels.The components are extremely low quality. The screws wouldn't go in correctly and worse, wouldn't stay in. I was constantly finding screws that had worked their way loose and would fall to the carpet below. I have a small puppy and worried that he would pick up a screw and swallow it. I had to check the floor before I could let the puppy in the bedroom and was always pulling the fluff bits that had shredded off out of his mouth between daily vacuumings. The puppy is a very small breed and the torn off felt material was another choking hazard.Before I even got the free time to recover the unit in carpet, it began to fall apart. The posts that hold the too-small platforms were very wobbly and within the first month, the plastic component at the join of the square house and the post broke when my cat was climbing it, sending both the post and cat to the floor. This is a small-frame 10 pound cat.The cat tree went to the trash because the components were not even sturdy enough to spend the time reinforcing and covering with decent carpeting. I strongly advise you not to waste your money. It's a matter of getting what you pay for. I didn't want to spend $200 on a cat tree, but now I will be spending that plus the $100+ that I wasted buying this inferior cat tree.

So I'll be returning the replacement and cutting a 2x4 to brace the collapsing corner myself. Thus the loss of 2 stars. In terms of kitty-love, they give it 4.5. They took off a half star for the cheapo dangling mouse toy that they had dissected in minutes. Replaced with a bit of shoelace and they are good with that. update:We decided we didn't like how high the upper platform was, so I took it off, screwed the post onto the furry side and have it as a floor-level independent scratching post. The kitties like that a lot too. Also didn't care for the orientation of the larger (level one) box. We turned it around so the door is facing the platform - MUCH more play friendly. You either need to drill another hole for the support tube or leave the bottom sit \"free\". Now that I have a 2x4 supporting the corner I am OK with no drilled hole.",

The item that arrived to me is entirely the same color. There is not shade difference as pictured in the 'beige' model.2. One of the 'houses' arrived broken. This is not surprising becuase the walls of the houses are made with the same crappy cardboard you would find as the backboard on an Ikea bookshelf. I'm not sure of the long term structural stability of those considering one my my cats immediate jumped on it to climb to the top with his claws.3. The inside of the \"houses\" are not carpeted. I found this strange as every cat condo I have owned so far has had carpet inside those. Another reminder of how cheaply made these are. I have to reinforce the broken wall anyway so when I do I will have to glue some carpet in there. Including this cost, I could have just bought the more expensive model.4. The bottom ramp secures with a single bolt to the bottom of the 'house' platform and a single bolt to the underside of the ramp itself. No matter how much I tighten these I can't get that ramp to stay in place. I may remove it completely.Overall, I'm disappointed but don't feel like dealing with boxing it back up and returning it.",

Seemed more functional to her. The gluing of the the material has heavy with hard seams.I returned the product and bought a different maker who applied the concept of equalizing the double sided thread screws which stopped customers from screwing too far, lining that didn't shed, No hard spots from excessive glue, and an optional wall attachment to stabilize the bungalow. My cat ( 1 year old) was immediately more interested in the alternative.Bottom line - This is a nice sized Cat Bungalow with a great look, but very little else. There are others around the same price with a bit more thought put into them and less of a chore/maintenance than this one.

The item weighs more than the estimated 52 pounds (converted from the 24 KG) and it says on the outside of the box 54 pounds. They also have directions for lifting of two people, so you know this weighs more than described. My grown husband and son both carried this box up the stairs. My main issue is with the delivery. The PO would not deliver it and Amazon called on my behalf to have them schedule two deliveries. The reason for making this purchase online and with Amazon is to have it delivered.Once I personally went to pick it up, with help of a neighbor to drive us there, the unpacking started. The god awful smell will linger in your house for hours. You might want to open the box and let it air out on the porch. The directions were easy to follow. Assembly happened in a short 10 minutes on my own. The stability is terrible and construction of this items is awful. I have 2 other cat towers that are far better than this one and sure wished I didn't look at the reviews that were positive.You can note the photos, the rope is not like my other cat trees. I don't believe this is sisal rope and when I assembled, the rope actually cut my fingers when I was twisting it together. There is so many sharp ends sticking out, more like a plastic twine rope. There is also an end that is attached by a staple, so a few scratches and you can already see where this is going to go. The posts also are wrapped with the material, and as you can see, the ends are going to be pulled up easily.As for your cats, it is very small. In the photo you will see my gray cat that is rather large, about 12 pounds, he can not fit into the top box. The larger box is at the bottom and we all know as cat owners, they like to be up high. Why this was designed with a super small box at the top is something I can't understand. The photo of the platforms at the top. My black and white cat is 5 years old, he is rather small and about 5 pounds. This skinny guy is taking up most the room, so my other cats will be cramped for space when they want to sleep on these.Overall, the problem you will also face will be just like mine. The shipping is not going to come to your door and you will be required to pick it up yourself. Might as well go to the pet store. I want you to know, this is the 3rd tree I have purchased on Amazon and the others arrived by UPS. You will also see this tree is super small with all the areas. The spacing between everything is smaller when you compare it to other brands.I have spoken with Amazon Customer Service through my entire experience and they are well aware that it didn't arrive to my home. No matter what they were told when calling the 1-800 number, your local office does what it wants.",

There are two wooden boards, one fur lined and one plain that construct the boxes, you use fluffy \"poles\" to keep the boards separated. After constructing them you put on a fur lined \"skin\" over the two boards and the poles and this offers the enclosed feeling. The issue is, these \"skins\" are not attached to ANYTHING! they tie on and come loose VERY easily. My cats were only playing on the toy for 15 minutes and I had to tighten it again. The holes to enter the condo area are in this \"skin\" and not in the board, so if your cat misses, he or she could possibly rip it right off, depending on how heavy they are. Also, this toy is very wobbly. My cats are less than 10 lbs each but they still will not use the top perch because when they jump up there it moves a lot and scares them.",

However, when it arrived the roof of the lower cat box was completely caved in. My husband was able to repair it with spare plywood we had at home. Upon completion, we also noticed how unstable the ladders are. The carpet/fabric is also a silky material vs a carpeting like in other cat towers (our cats do not scratch the silky material so it's a waste). After about 1month of use, my cats somehow broke one of the three middle support poles, so now the whole tower looks like it is about to fall over. I am giving this a 2 star because it arrived quickly, was cheap, and my cats like the hanging mouse (although that broke off as well). All in all, it is a waste of money as we will have to buy a different now.",

The layout is also too compact making them contort awkwardly to jump between levels. The ramps are too small for them as well. The fabric on the tree isn't very good for them to grab either so playing on this would be a challenge. Overall I found the tree to be too flimsy for large cats.

However, if you notice there is a toy dangling from the bed with a piece of elastic that you can see from my video is not safe. Within 10 minutes of being on the tower and playing with the toy, my 10-week-old kitten got the elastic wrapped around his paw and stuck because the ball is so large. The audio is delayed for some reason so it doesn’t line up with the video like it should, but you can hear his screams for help. Thank goodness I was home with them and was able to immediately come get him.

The only thing i have to fault it is the assembly is awful. The W2 screws are too short to go where they need to. I ended up using the W3 because both me and my husband couldnt get the W2s where they needed to go. Also, the boxes that the cats go into, you have to poles inside of and assemble from the inside of the tower. Really inconvient. There's also exposed screw tops and absolutely nothing to cover them up like a cap or fabric. And finally, im not sure Why, but there's what seems to be hot glue strings (if youve used hot glue you know what i mean) all over the product. Seems like that's what they adhered the fabric to the wooden pieces with. Very annoying.",

A personal note, our cats didn't like any of the hanging spots or the nooks, but perhaps they were too small for them to really enjoy.Here's the real problem, only 2 months into having this, the top tier disconnected at the base of the cylinder. It was attached to the lower level with 4 or 5 staples only. It crashed down and destroyed some of our planters sitting on a windowsill nearby. I removed the staples and reattached the tower with 3 screws. In just another 2 months, the screws held, but the plastic that connected the cylinder to the bolt just broke.If you get this product, only expect it to last while your cats are small. An average sized cat will bring it down. I'd recommend you purchase a different model with a better supported top tier.",

Definitely not for grown cats.This order was placed on a Saturday, and delivered the next day. As in Sunday. Amazing, even for Amazon. The cat tree arrived in perfect condition, was quick & easy to assemble, and is quite solid and well balanced, even on carpet. I do think it would be more appropriate for smaller kits or maybe kittens, as some of the nooks and crannies are just too bitty for an adult cat. The scratching sisal is proving to be a hit with my three cats, but they've already shredded the carpet layer above the sisal because the sisal doesn't extend all the way up to the first floor. I expect I'll be doing some sisal wrapping in the future. That said, so far the tower of fun is mostly ignored by my two big cats, and even the smallest one has some - er - issues fitting into the top level, which is his favorite spot in the entire house now.

My cat isn't fat but he's also no kitten, I used it for storage of his grooming tools and a small jar of cat nip and I kid you not that is all that fits in there.

That being said, I expect he'll outgrow this cat condo by the time he's a year old. The tube at the top is very short and small. While he doesn't look cramped now in the sheltered cylinder on the second level, I expect he will be by the time he's fully grown. Also, be careful of the hardware that holds up the hammock. There's nothing that stops the hooks from going straight through the second level shelf and I caught my hand on them a few times while putting it together.As for the structure as a whole, it's fairly solid. My kitten treated the house like a parkour course before I bought this product and even with him launching off myself and other furniture onto the condo, it hardly even wobbles. The only part that is iffy is the 4th tier where the tube hangs. I tightened it until it didn't turn anymore when I built it and over the course of three days I've been able (and needed) to tighten it twice more.The last thing is something that took me by surprise. Usually, as well as the sisal rope, cat trees are made with rough carpeting. This tree isn't covered in carpet, but rather a soft, furry type cloth. The kind like plush toys are made of. It comes out easy, so expect a fuzzy mess to sweep up after building it and for that to continue if your kitty claws any part besides the sisal rope.It was very easy to build. The diagram is easy to follow and there's an included hex key.EDIT (2/28/15): At roughly the two week mark, the 4th tier loose part (mentioned earlier) broke entirely. I hadn't tightened it any more after the review was written, but I noticed it getting more and more wobbly. I decided to take that part off to see what was going on. The tubes themselves are hollow cardboard with a black plastic cap. Inserted within the cap is a nut that is what grips the threads and holds the tube to the provided screws.The reason that tier was wobbling was because the black plastic, through normal cat use, broke. The nut stayed on the screw so that the whole piece was able to just be lifted off; no unscrewing required.This just reinforces that if you have a cat who is REALLY active or heavier (I'd say more than 5 pounds), then find another cat tree.",

It would really only be functional for a kitten. The material is very poor quality. We have not even had this for a year and already it is a shabby broken mess, The cats have shredded most of the lower carpet material right off the posts and the ladder. The hammock broke the first day. The third tier snapped off after just a few months. It wobbles whenever they jump on it.

As the other reviewers said, it is wobbly and the components are quite small. The platforms are great, but the hammocks, tube, and little house are probably big enough for a very young kitten. My kitten is six months old and theres no way he could fit into any of these pieces!With the wobbly parts, I took it back apart, took off a few components, and rearranged it so that it's shorter and has more supports. So I feel that it's safer now but the cats still won't play on it. My kitten is only interested in the small rope toy (I have it hanging from the bottom level roof). My larger cat is only about 9-10 pounds and she won't go near it on her own. I got them both to go up it by putting their food bowls up there, but after they were done eating, both of them went right back to their place on the window sill.So, basically I bought a $100 staircase for the cats to get up to the windowsill. I contacted the seller in hopes of returning it, so hopefully that will work out and shipping won't be $50. Just buy your cats a small rope, that's the only part of this mine are interested in.",

The only two useful spots are the flat upper platform and the top perch platform. Also, there isn't enough room on the platform with the \"cubbyhole\" house for either one to really turn around even. The ladder is kind of useless, unless you are using it for kittens. It would be wonderful for kittens as a jungle gym! But with adults--especially large adult cats--it doesn't work well. Also, my older cat (12 years) has trouble getting down from the upper large flat platform, he has no where to jump down to a lower level, as the platforms are about the same width leaving no space to jump down on top of.

A 45-degree cut along that edge would likely solve that problem. Also, the screw hooks for the hanging hammock below the second floor are both too thin and too long. They barely thread into their mounting holes; and, if fully tightened, pointedly protrude through the carpeting--constituting an injury hazard for cats. Other than the manufacturer supplying larger-diameter hooks, in the future, the only effective current solution is to cover them in Loc-Tite; and, partially thread them into the provided holes.",

The entire tree, once assembled, isn't very stable. Even when we double checked to make sure all the posts were fastened together as tightly as they could be, the cat tree is still very wobbly. If our cat was to jump up to the top tier or the \"hammock\" on the side, this tree would definitely fall over. Thankfully she can sense this and hasn't gone past the large perch which is under the highest tier with the small tunnel underneath it. Not that she could go anywhere else on this tree as she wouldn't fit comfortably.All of the sisal is good for the cat to scratch, but that is the only good quality this cat tree features.Even if you have a kitten, or kittens, they will quickly outgrow this cat tree.This is not a good quality piece of pet furniture.

He has a hard time pulling himself up and there is really not the space on the second level for him to get a solid foot hold to jump up, with the hole and the hideout taking most of the space. The fourth level, hammock and whatever that is in the way on the middle post are lost in my house. He won't use them. For a household with smaller pets, this might work better. The second level needs to be a bit wider so the cats would have an area to jump to the third level. Awkward with the current design.

The top part isn't too stable, and I have a rather small male cat. after jumping off it and onto it over a few months, it started loosening up. Believe it or not, the cats managed to break the plastic cap which has the threading for the bolt onto of it. Rammed a few drywall screws through it to hold it together for a while. Back in October it finally broke for good. I find the cubby for them to be too small for most cats. I had a very small female runt which can sit in it, but that's the extent of it's use. The swinging part below, forget it. All three cats hated it. The ladder I found to be useless as well. They'll jump up onto it. They'll never walk up the ladder. Avoid this feature, it's a waste in my opinion. Overall, it's a bit shakey, so I'd keep it in the corner of the house. The walls seemed to keep it upright. Never fell over.Now for the pros. This thing, collects cat hair like no other. I have three long hair cats, and most of their hair ends up on this, not around the house. They love sitting on it in the window (it's now in two pieces to sit in the window area in the living room). The basket my runt cat loves and tends to hide in it well. The posts my cats gravitate to. I have cedar board walls in two spots in the house, and not a single scratch, thanks to this. The rope they do play with or bite on as well, and when there are a few on it they do tend to play quite a bit on it batting each other. Another pro, is that you can mix parts around when something does break. Like I stated before, the top broke, but I was able to move around a few pieces and reconfigure it to keep using it. I've owned it for 2 years now, it's still being used. Would I recommend it? Probably not unfortunately because, most people have probably larger cats than mine. two of them are 9lbs, one is 6lbs. It's too small for the 9lbers to use some parts of it. I'd recommend probably getting some tools and material and building your own out of wood. Even if it isn't covered in carpet or a fleece material, my cats like the natural wood on my home made cat scratch and even lay on the base of it. If you do decide to still get one of these, I'd suggest liquid nailing the posts in place and using some lock tight on the bolts to keep it together. However, I feel that since it's made out of cardboard tubes and plastic in some spots, it'll still break eventually.",

The oddest part of the design is that the second level platform is the same width and length as the first, so the cats cannot jump from the first to second platform directly. The hammock and fabric nest are pretty small. Fine for the kittens, but the adult does not use those at all, and if she did, I don't think the fabric nest could support her weight.

The shelves have another problem, they're pillowed, so they kind of puff upwards. Cats like depressions. My cats won't even stand on the top platforms. My cats are big. 16 and 14 lbs and not fat and they're just too big for this tree and it's low shelfs and smaller spaces and puffy surfaces.It's pretty and it's soft. It's a little harder to put together than the other trees I've bought, but that doesn't bother me. What does bother me is that my cats won't use it. My mother wanted a prettier cat tree and this one is prettier than my old, some of the ropes coming off, larger previous one, but my cats won't use it. I gave them two weeks. They've tried it out, but I think my cats think I'm stupid for buying this thing.It might be OK if you have 8 or 10 (or smaller) cats, but athletic jumpers and climbers will be disappointed with this one.

I also twisted the top house so that the opening to the top house face the cat holes for easier access.It is well constructed and went together quickly and a nice smokey grey color. I'll keep it and make further modifications to resolve issues because I don't feel like going through the hassle of returning it.

The photos and print in the instructions are tiny, making it a bit of a challenge to read. But it is pretty simple to figure out what part goes where.The cats absolutely love this tower - jumping from level to level, climbing the jute post, swatting the attached toys, lazing on the perches.Two stars because the fabric is extremely thin and is already starting to tear after 2 1/2 months of light use. Additionally, the tower wobbles pretty dramatically when they jump from the floor onto one of the platforms. It hasn't tipped over yet, and because the base is so large, it doesn't seem likely to.Overall a disappointing purchase because of the quality of the fabric covering. I intend to file a claim under the AmazonBasics warranty re: the tearing fabric. Hopefully they will replace the platform with the tears. I will update my review after I get a response to my warranty claim.",

I can literally pinch the cloth together and it's just so thin, nothing for the cats to grab onto. The flat landing areas are hard and because the material slides, the cats kind of skid when they get up on the tree because there's nothing for them to sink their claws into.

I've had it two days and it wobbles every time my cat jumps up on it as the base is not heavy enough. I have it against a wall otherwise it would probably fall over. I think my cats do not feel secure on it too, because there's only one cat on it at a time (there's typically a couple cats hanging out on a tree together, but never this one). It has a cool design and the cats like the little cave, and of course, sleeping on the top box. The two box-like sections are only big enough for one cat to lay or sleep on though (so no cuddle sleeping together like they enjoy). The tree itself is short, meaning each section is very close to each other, and although there are a lot of rope-covered poles, they are short so the adult cats can't exactly scratch on them (so they are kind of useless).",

The perch is also very unstable and shaky, and I doubt it’d support a cat trying to jump into it. My cat refuses to try either part of it, even being placed in the bowl, and she has always loved bowl-hammocks before.The scratching posts are about the same compared to other products like this, except the staples holding the string are exposed. Not a problem for my cat, but for cats that scratch aggressively or like scratching near the edges, this could be an issue.Overall, the product is too small, and is pretty structurally unstable. The other products on Amazon at this price range are much better, including the Amazon brand one, so I wouldn’t recommend this based on that fact, but if you could get this for a big discount it may be okay for kittens that don’t scratch hard but I’d keep an eye to make sure they don’t tip it over.

It's shaky to say the least, will probably break if you happen to have cats that like to play in any way.3) There's less than 10 grommets the size of a quarter yet one was missing, not in the box, nowhere to be found. This was for the little \"house\" part of the tower so there's literally only one screw holding it down - gonna have to go back to the hardware store.I'm a handyman and made it work the best I could and it's still inherently unstable, gave me 2+ unplanned trips to the hardware store and it's probably gonna break. If I can find the time to dismantle this POS I would gladly return it but that's gonna be a real pain in the *** for me.

I have 2 larger Ragdoll cats (They are a big breed), 12lbs and 14lbs. The 14 lb guy (His name is Littles) cannot comfortably fit on the two upper pedestals. He tries for a while but eventually his large turkey butt slides off, he gets uncomfortable. My 12 pounder fits and think this is the upper size limit the condo was designed for.I modified the condo by installing a custom large top pedestal. Just used some plywood and upholstered it with cushioning and cloth. Attached it with provided bolt and it is fatty's new favorite spot. Put it in my home office in the corner (also enables him to lean up on the wall) and he spends all day on it.See the pictures of the fat cat mod posted. I think other cat condos are similarly limited but Mud Bay frowns on dropping my cats off for the day to test their cat condo selection. I think selling a fat cat/luxury pedestal mod could be a good business.",

The tower arrives in pieces and you only need a small hex wrench to put it together. The problem as I can see it is that the screws supplied are too small to connect the top levels of the tower. There is just not enough length on the screw to thread into the poles. I think simply buying a few extra lag bolts from a hardware store should fix the problems but overall I am extremely disappointed with that. Each level is fully padded but the carpeting they use is not very plush, versus the quality of the towers that you can buy from a larger Pet Store chain. The size would be pretty impressive if we were able to install the top two levels and the piece overall feels sturdy. Some levels also have exposed screw heads. It will probably not both your cat but it just looks a little cheap. You get what you pay for and a tower of similar size and height from a pet store would easily be double this cost but also double the quality.",

The item was easy to assemble with easy instructions literally labeling all the parts with letters and pictures. The hole was also big enough to fit my large cat. He's not fat but large in size.

The unit I received already was badly broken all the way across the base and was only being held together by the fabric, so of course it is going back, but I am sending it for refund not exchange after some consideration.The good:The little house/den is a good size for my small cats to use and my kitten already seemed interested in it. It is both open enough that they won't feel confined and closed enough that they won't feel exposed.The build quality seemed good -- corners were nicely done, no stray threads or staples poking out, no splinters or rough places (except where it was broken)A light-weight cat tree is easy to move around and put in place.I think the fleecy fabric might stand up to clawing better than carpet does.The bad:The platforms are smaller than I expected and don't have very high sides, so they're really only good for very small cats/young kittens to lounge on or for other cats to sit on. I think my 6-mo old kitten is already too big to spread out much on it and I wouldn't trust my elderly cat not to fall off in her sleep.And, of course, made out of flimsy particle board, even the base.

It's been a few days and the smell is dissipating but when I first opened the package it smelled very strong of formaldehyde and gave me a headache. I couldn't be in the same room with it for the first day. I am guessing it is coming from the particle board which sometimes uses formaldehyde in the manufacturing. It is manufactured in China and it had me wondering if it conforms to US air quality standards. At any rate, the cats seem to like it and it doesn't smell as bad now. I sort of wished I had just unpacked the box and left the pieces to air out on the back porch for a week before bringing these toxic fumes into the house.Update: We've had this for a few years now. The smell did get better, but never totally dissipated and still smells faintly of formaldehyde/formalin. Our cat who loved this tree the most and spent the most time sleeping on it recently developed bone marrow cancer and we had to put him down. After he got sick I looked up health effects from formaldehyde exposure and it is in fact linked to this form of cancer. Of course we will never know if this cat tree contributed to our cat getting sick, but I'll be putting it out in the trash.",

This seemed to fit the bill so I got it.

The carpet that covers it is a weird \"fabric\" and not easy to clean and it is not the most stable. I tried the dangly toy for about a minute- it's on a rubbery string and it came off quickly, tempting my cat to play with it too much and I was concerned he might choke on it so that was thrown away. The rope that dangles is so close to the posts that they can't really play. I would not recommend nor would I purchase again.",

I have built one cat platform with scratching post using 4x4 and the cost of the rope alone was nearly $20 and it only was 30\" tall. Plus rug adhesive, the hassle of building it.I like the design, minor quibble is that our main cat that uses it is not the biggest cat I've seen but he's big and 14 lbs, and he does not fit the platforms at the top well. He hangs off every side. 12x14\" is not big enough for USA cats, although he manages. The tubes are plastic/cardboard mix, but seem to work ok. The boards are all flake board as expected, a bit thin at roughly 1/2\" or maybe 5/8\". The base is too thin, and the towers wiggle a bit causing my cat to look somewhat nervous when going up/down. I will likely cut a 3/4\" plywood base and glue to the bottom for added stability.That said, I could not have justified spending a whole day making one of these from my scraps in my shop when I can get it all nicely finished for about $100 from Amazon delivered. Sure beats the prices at the pet store. I will likely cut some plywood and make a bigger platform for the top one and cover with something similar, but my wife thinks I'm crazy.Positives:* Lots of places for your cats to sit. Mine spent the first three days camped out in the house, now he sleeps on the top platform (even though he's hanging off edges!)* Assembles easily* Comes with tool for assembly* lots of scratching places. My fat cat likes the lower ones, where she can lay and scratch, the big male the higher ones.* hanging toys are entertaining.Negatives:* Small size design - the platforms, house, everything is more for smaller framed cats. Dont get this if you have huge cats they wont like it much.* A bit thin on the fuzzy covering but OK* could be sturdier* could be made from thicker wood* does not have any \"feet\" for bottom* my cat at first preferred the box it came in* now one of the cats does not sleep with my daughter anymore, he sleeps on the cat tree!

                              "ch_title": "Update June 18, 2020. The pole to the top perch had been really leaning last couple days to the point my cat wasn’t using it. Guess he tried it tonight. Was woken up hearing a thud. Looked over and the top highest perch was laying on the floor. The plastic base and screw were firmly in place. The cardboard tube attached to the plastic with just a few short, sharp nilas. Not enough to hold something tall that has a perch on top apparently. I’ve gotten the plastic piece unscrewed and removed. My cat, I think, is okay, but he’s freaked out. This is not quite 8 months old! My cat weighs in around 12 pounds. He’s active, but not destructive. Be aware of this potential flaw that could harm your cat or home depending on where you place it. I’m very! Unhappy with this cat tree, revising rating to a 1 star.Update: it’s now May 19, 2020, so around 7 months. My cat is an active approximately 12lb cat. The top 2 perch poles won’t tighten any further, but when he gets up on either of them, they sway! See video. So sorry to say, this cat tree isn’t the best. It should at least make it a year before it starts to fall apart for the price.My cat was in need of a new tree as he destroyed his last one. Got the grey xl model. It weighs around 40lbs. It’s bigger than I expected. It’s wide. I’d like it better if it didn’t have the ledge that sticks out at an angle. That angle, watch how you put the first legs in. The instructions aren’t clear on how and which legs go where. There was some taking apart and moving the legs around. The grey material is very soft! I just don’t know how sturdy it will be. The sisal on the wrapped legs could definitely be better. It’s thin. I can see I’ll be having to buy sisal and wrap them again. Overall it’ll do, because it has to. But it’s not a $65 product. $50 would be more in line. All parts were in the box. Note: I didn’t realize this is supposed to go in a corner, which I can’t do. It is braced against the wall and window sill.",

I’m shocked because I’ve purchased Amazon Basics products several times before and always been happy with the quality. I don’t want to waste my time or anyone else’s time returning it, so I may try bringing the platform to the hardware store to find a matching screw. Very disappointed in you though, Amazon.

I wound up adapting a cat carrier pad to the top perch so that he would have something large enough to lie on. Neither cat has ever scratched on the posts, or tried to use the ladder (due to the small cave). After a couple of months of use, the posts started getting wobbly because the staples used to hold the plastic ends into the cardboard tubes started working their way out. My solution was to use three small wood screws on each end of each post to hopefully fix the problem. So far, so good. My younger cat spends a lot of time napping on the bed I attached to the upper perch, so it, with modification, is useful for that. The \"bed\" that was supposed to be in the box was not in the packaging anywhere, but I could tell that it would have been too small anyway. If you are not handy with tools, or do not want the hassle of making it work, or if you have adult cats, you should probably steer clear of this tree, and spend a little more money for one that is designed for adult cats.",

The makers know this because they include a tiny anchor to put into your wall to strap it with a tiny plastic belt to keep it from happening. The weight of the tree would surely pull that tiny anchor our of the wall. The bolt for attaching the tunnel is too short to grasp the tunnel, and if it were long enough it would stick up in the middle of the tunnel and cause injury to the animals. The covering of the surfaces is plush fiber like a stuffed toy. It would not last under the wear and tear of cats' claws. (Also, there are only drawing, no written instructions. Three different lengths of bolts making it difficult to sort out where each goes.) Thank you for honoring my return.",

The poles that hold up the tree are at least an inch skinnier. Only 3 of the legs are covered in sisal rope , unlike all of the legs being covered on the SONGMICS one. The tree just has that cheaper \"knock off\" feel. Also the 2 houses and hammock are super small and not good for an adult cat. The only thing better about it is that the top 2 tiers are very cushioned compared to the SONGOMICS. I have one small 9lb female and a 15lb Male cat. The male is what I was worried about when making this purchase. If I'm going to spend the same amount of money, I'm getting the better tree, so I'm sending this one back.",

I taught my babies young not to claw, so I can't saw much on the scratchers but for their lazy life style, thisbis absolutely perfect. The houses are very roomy and they can sprawl out comfortably. I'm extremely happy with my purchase and will purchase again in the future. Highly recommend. The hammock goes unused but is removable.",

They completed ripped through the front of the house fabric, and also started to do so on the sides. I’ve only had this tree for a couple of weeks and it’s already torn up on the house section. Not to mention cats like to eat strings...and this fabric when ripped up is nothing but strings. My cat was choking yesterday and though she finally stopped and seemed fine after a few seconds, I noticed the strings hanging off the cat tree and can only hope that she’s not literally eating the fabric. Which, wouldn’t surprise me if she was. I can’t be the only one who has had this problem. I’m really shocked that the houses aren’t durable and stabilized by hardwood. Or least made with something not so easily destroyed and potentially dangerous to cats. I’m disappointed in this product, it doesn’t say anywhere in discriptions that the tree is made this way. Had it, I wouldn’t have purchased. I literally had to cut off the front of the house to get rid of the hanging fabric and strings that she was gnawing on (shown in picture).",

                              "en_content": "I wouldn’t buy this again, and I’m kicking myself for not returning it when I had the chance. The list of reasons is long.First, I just want to say that I hate that this product page is for every tree made by this company because it makes it really difficult to find reviews for the product you’re looking at. I’m including pictures so you can see which one I have. It’s got two “stories,” a small box, a large box, and a ball activity box on top of one of the 3 pillars on top.When I received the tree, the pieces that are supposed to come assembled weren’t assembled properly. The supports that go inside the boxes to hold the roofs up weren’t attached at all, so I had to install them myself.There are pieces on this tree that could be dangerous for your cat. For example, inside the ball activity box, there’s a brass piece that you screw the post into, but it doesn’t lay flush with the bottom of the activity box, and there are holes your cat can get its claws stuck in. This is particularly dangerous because the whole point of the activity box is for your cat to fish inside with its paws. I covered the piece with hot glue and so far haven’t had a problem, but I’ve read reviews on here from other cat guardians who had to hurt their cat to get their cat’s claws free.The rope is held on the scratching post with industrial staples which is really dangerous.As far as size goes, this tree is really designed for kittens (I’ll never understand why cat trees are designed for less than 6 months of a cat’s life). My girl cat is chunky, but she’s a relatively small cat, and she doesn’t fit in the small box. She also almost got herself stuck in the hole in the roof of the larger box.It’s extremely top heavy and entirely too narrow to support itself, which results in way too much wobbling for my larger cat to be comfortable playing on it. He climbs it occasionally, but just sits on top, which is heartbreaking to watch because until he got scared by the wobble, he loved the toys on the pillars.The ladder is flush with the edge of the bottom box, which makes climbing down really difficult because there’s no lip for cats to rest their paws on. And since the top of that box has a hole in it, there’s nowhere beside the ladder for them to step.When you put the tree together as directed, there is only 1 post with sisal rope at ground level, so if your cats don’t like scratching that fleece-like material (mine don’t), they’re going to wear it out pretty quickly. And there are no posts short enough to go under the bottom box that have sisal rope on them, so even then, there will only be 2 sisal posts at ground level. Which wouldn’t be as much of a problem if it wasn’t so wobbly, but since it is, my cats aren’t comfortable scratching the higher posts.The sisal rope is garbage. We received this tree on December 7, and the cats had already ripped through the sisal rope by February.All in all, this tree is dangerous, bad quality, and definitely not meant for large cats. Don’t buy it.",

When it arrived, we unpackaged it and began assembly (which wasn't too bad) and during this process, we discoved that each platform is comprised of very thin felt-like material stretched over hardened particle board. There is no padding between the felt-like cloth and the board, so cats cannot sink their claws into the material, which they need to do to climb or play on the cat tree. The \"cat hide\" featured in the photograph is that same felt-like material with some elastic strips that allow for streatching the material over the adjacent platforms where it is located. You can see from the photos what I'm trying to describe. The cat tree is also somewhat unstable, as each time our cat (13 pounds) jumps up to the top level it bumps into the wall next to where we have it assembled. The top platform is also too small for an average sized cat. It might be okay for smaller cats. None of this is discernable from the photos used on-line to advertise it. The one good thing are the rope-wrapped supports. They appear to be well-made. Do not buy this tree if you want your cat to play or climb on it.",

My cat is about 15 pounds isnt even the biggest type of cat and the stability and size of the bed does not work for her. A complete waste of money do not buy if you cat is bigger or heavy it will not work. I love my fatty cat and she is super sad cause she cant use her new bed.

Another reason for purchasing this model was for the cup at the bottom.

I used my own washers under all screws to give more strength to the anchors. I felt the particle board wasn't strong enough without the washers. There are some trade offs. If thicker platform boards had been used, there would have been more weight. The model, as is, is easy to move around. Not too much weight. The picture instructions are fine. The scratching posts would be better if covered the entire length with the clawing rope. My guess is the platforms on which the top posts sit, which hold the weight of the cats and resting perches, will sag over time because the particle board isn't too thick. I will do an update in a few weeks. Being made in China, the business idea of cheap, even if Americans own the company, is irritating. But it was my choice.",

The assembly instructions were very easy to follow, and nearly everything fit like it was supposed to. The only issue is that the lower-tier cat bed that rests atop a scratching post fell off the cat tree this morning because the plastic at the base of the post wasn't sturdy enough (pictured)--it wouldn't screw in all the way in the first place and was very wobbly when assembled. The rest of the cat tree is very sturdy, however, so we just used one of the spare flat-head screws to fill in the hole left by this out-of-commission scratching post. It's disappointing that only one of the beds remains on the tree because I have two cats, but we repurposed the other bed to lying on the floor next to their favorite window. Overall, this is a great cat tree--that one part not being sturdy was just disappointing because of the price I paid for the full product.",

The quality is great, the wood is pretty thick and the coverings are so soft and fuzzy. It was fairly easy to put together overall. I did discover one mistake I made but it didn't affect the sturdiness overall. The upper part of the kitty condo should have the post on the outside right corner but the covering had a hole on the left not the right. I had to use the tree for support to get up off the floor several times and it never leaned or tipped over.If you have true kittens this would be great for them! Weight isn't an issue,except for the basket, that doesn't seem sturdy at all, but length and height sure are. My babies will out grow this in a few months.",

The top box is also not a box. It has a top and bottom board with no boards in the sides. It is held up by the inside pillars and the top board screwed to the upper pillar. The last think I don't like is the top pad. With the rolled edges it looks padded in the picture but it is not padded on the bottom. It is like a pillow cover that you put over the top board.
